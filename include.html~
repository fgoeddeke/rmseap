<h4>RMSEA-P Calculator</h4>

<p>RMSEA-P is a measure of model fit in structural equations modeling that isolates the fit of the latent variables from the fit of the measurement model, making it superior to other fit measures.</p>
 
<p>You can calculate RMSEA-P by simply entering the values for your model on the left.  Default values for one example are already provided, you should overwrite them with your own model values.  Your RMSEA-P and 90% C.I. values will be displayed on the right side. The calculator will automatically update with your RMSEA-P and C.I. values.  There is no need for a "submit" button.</p> 

<p>You should use good judgment regarding the number of decimal places to use and report.</p>

<p>You will receive a NaN error value for RMSEA-P and C.I. values unless you enter correct and positive numerical values from your model.</p>
